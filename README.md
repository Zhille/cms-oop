# CMS-Gallery System / project in Object Oriented way. :)

#Home
So,on the main page navigation bar have only 2 bars, one is for 'Home' and another one is for Admin section, ofcourse you need to log in first if you want to access to Admin section. 
In the home page are all the photos that are uploaded. The limit is eight photos per page. By clicking on any of them you will be redirected to page which contains some informations about that specific post ( photo ), like upload date, caption, description, and all comments that belong to that post. 
In this case, gallery doesn't have a lot of photos, but if it have, we would need the pagination to organize how much we want to display at the moment in specific page, pagination is dymanic which means the number of pages depend's of number of photos that are uploaded.
